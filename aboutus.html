        <h1>Our purpose</h1>
        <br />
        <h3>
          As bank-insurer, our purpose is to help all our stakeholders realise
          their dreams and protect them.
        </h3>
        <br />
        We aspire at being far more than a bank and an insurance: we want to
        enable and protect the dreams of our clients. Even more: we want to
        inspire, boost and stimulate those who count on us, day after day. <br>What
        we do, we do it so that others can grow and achieve their respective
        goals: we enable our retail clients to plan and realise their projects,
        and help them to then protect them; we cooperate with our business
        clients so that they can grow and develop in the long term; <br> we drive
        local economies so that communities can further develop, we offer
        services to their citizens, opportunities for their young people; we are
        preparing for tomorrow’s challenges, so that our current and future
        employees can develop their potential.

        <h2>Our vision</h2>
        <h3>
          Our vision: to be the reference for bank-insurance in all our core
          markets
        </h3>

        KBC is a group of 40 000 talented employees in different countries who
        work together and share a common culture.
        <br />Our culture is the fertile and energizing soil on which we build
        our strategy, consisting of 4 cornerstones, interacting with each other:
        <ul>
          <li>
            We strive to offer our clients a unique bank insurance experience
          </li>
          <li>
            We develop our group with a long term perspective and therefore
            achieve sustainable and profitable growth
          </li>
          <li>
            We put our clients’ interests at the heart of what we do and strive
            to offer them at all times a high quality service and relevant
            solutions
          </li>
          <li>
            We take our responsibility towards society and local economies very
            seriously and aim to reflect that in our everyday activities
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        We are convinced that our strategy - powered by our culture and with the
        contribution of our people–helps us earn, keep and grow trust day by day
        and therefore makes us become the reference in our core markets.
