          and our business model, and have ensured that this structure supports
          effective decision-making and individual accountability. Our group is
          essentially structured around three business units, which focus on the
          local business and are expected to contribute to sustainable earnings
          and growth. The business units are Belgium, the Czech Republic and
          International Markets.
          <br />

          in control of two underlying companies, viz. KBC Bank NV and KBC
